# ðŸ§© Challenge One: The enigma

## Overview

This challenge requires the participants to find the coordinates of a location which is encrypted in a given file.

### Knowledge

No prior knowledge required.

## Files provided

- `encrypt.py`: python file encrypting the text
- `encrypted.txt`: encrypted message

## Documentation

### Step 1: Understand the vulnerability

The file responsible for the encryption has a flaw in how the encryption is implemented.

### Step 2: Decrypt the file

Based on the vulnerability found in the previous step, there are two possible ways to solve it.

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation will be based on the number of participants who are able to provide the correct coordinates. After a certain number of participants solve the challenge, the points awarded will decrease.
