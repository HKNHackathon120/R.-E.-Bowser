# Ralph Emmet Bowser

Ralph Emmet Bowser fully embraced the university experience during his time at the University of Illinois. He was not only a member of the Electrical Engineering Club but also a senior member of the Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Pi and an assistant editor of Technograph, a magazine focused on engineering and new technologies. After completing a brilliant academic career with a thesis on interurban railway car testing, in collaboration with M.L. Carr, he embarked on a successful career in the electric field.

## The nemesis
But disaster struck when Bowser was abducted by Dr. Alexander Gastani Frinzi, a misanthropic and unyielding figure. He firmly believes in isolating himself from others, living by the motto, ‚ÄúBetter off alone.‚Äù For him, collaboration only creates problems, offering no real benefit. Driven by this belief, he works on every project in complete solitude.


### üß© Challenge One: The enigma
In an attempt to prove that the affection HKN members feel for Brother Bowser is merely a facade, Dr. Frinzi has hidden him in an unknown location. However, he left behind a few cryptic clues. In his magazine *Alceste*, where he serves as President, Editor-in-Chief, Business Manager, Advisor‚Ä¶ (you get the idea), he wrote a mysterious article, which likely contains a hidden message. Can you find it?

### üêçÔ∏è Challenge Two: Mini-snake
But that's not all. Dr. Frinzi wants to challenge you, eager to show that he can outmatch everyone on his own. Your task? Write a Python program with the smallest file size possible‚Äîmeasured in bytes. Can you rise to the challenge and prove him wrong?


### ü´Ç Challenge Three: One for all, all for one
And finally, HKN‚Äôs core values of integration and involvement mean no one is left behind. Can you convince Dr. Gastani Frinzi to change his solitary ways and join this vibrant community? Share a post with pictures of your chapter's activities and show him what he's missing out on!
